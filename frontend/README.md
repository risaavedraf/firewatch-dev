# FireWatch frontend

The FireWatch web application: a React 19 + TypeScript client built with Vite, served as
static assets on its own origin, and talking to the backend API on another. It replaced a
single-file, framework-free page; the reasons and the parity obligations are recorded in
[`odd/urgent/rediseno-pagina/app-react-vite.md`](../odd/urgent/rediseno-pagina/app-react-vite.md).

## Layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Vite entry: the document and the `#root` mount point. No page content lives here |
| `src/config.ts` | The two external origins, the identity provider, the consumed routes and the timing bounds |
| `src/types/api.ts` | Declared payload shapes. Declarations, not guarantees: consumers validate at the boundary |
| `src/app/routes.ts` | The seven views and their four navigation groups |
| `src/app/useHashRoute.ts` | Hash routing: reads the view from the address bar, follows back/forward, normalises an unknown hash |
| `src/components/Shell.tsx` | Sidebar, topbar, update bar and footer |
| `src/components/ui.tsx` | Presentation primitives: `Icon`, `Chip`, `Metric`, `PanelHeading`, `DataList`, `StatusCopy`, `EmptyState`, the "not implemented" markers |
| `src/components/map/` | Territorial map projection and level colouring |
| `src/core/api.ts` | Transport: one function per consumed route, absolute gateway URLs, sequence fences, deadlines |
| `src/core/session.ts` | OIDC PKCE, the in-memory token, the unverified role claim, logout |
| `src/domain/` | Pure rules: validity, level mapping, fail-closed batch and provenance acceptance, readiness, history filters |
| `src/views/` | The seven views |
| `src/styles/` | `tokens.css` (palette, level colours, type) and `app.css` (layout, components, responsive) |
| `scripts/serve.mjs` | Static server for the build output: explicit allowlist, CSP, no directory listing, no SPA fallback |
| `scripts/smoke.mjs` | Loopback check of that server against the build |
| `scripts/check.mjs` | Source gate: requires the honesty statement, forbids invented data, requires the real endpoints |
| `tests/` | Vitest suites (domain, core, map, app, views) |
| `legacy/` | The retired single-file page and its 60-assertion VM harness, kept runnable until every assertion is ported |

## Running it

The app needs the **backend running**: the gateway API on `http://localhost:8080` and Keycloak
on `http://localhost:8081`. See [`backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md#quick-start).

```sh
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server on http://localhost:4173
```

Then open **`http://localhost:4173`**.

> **Open it as `localhost`, never as `127.0.0.1`.** Both the Keycloak redirect URI and the
> gateway's allowed origin are registered for the `localhost` spelling. To a browser those are
> two different origins, so `http://127.0.0.1:4173` will fail login and cross-origin requests
> even though the server answers. Both the dev server and the preview server pin that exact
> origin and fail rather than move to another port.

The dev server is **not** the CSP witness: it injects its own scripts and sends no policy. Use
the built path below when the policy matters.

```sh
npm run build      # type-check, then build into dist/
npm run serve      # serve dist/ on http://localhost:4173 with the real headers
```

## Where it points

`src/config.ts` holds the only origin constants. None of them is a secret — a bundled client
has none — and all three are registered in services this repository does not own:

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gatewayOrigin` | `http://localhost:8080` | Prefixes every gateway call. Every API URL is absolute |
| `issuer` | `http://localhost:8081/realms/firewatch` | Identity provider. `/token`, `/auth` and `/logout` resolve against this, never the gateway |
| `redirectURI` | `http://localhost:4173/` | Must match the realm client's valid redirect URI |

`WEB_ORIGIN` on the gateway must be exactly `http://localhost:4173`, or the browser's
cross-origin calls are refused. `backend/docker-compose.yml` already sets it.

Login uses the public `firewatch-demo` client with Authorization Code and PKCE `S256`. Access
and ID tokens live in page memory only and are never written to cookies or to `localStorage`.
Exactly one non-token value touches browser storage: the PKCE transaction — `state` and
`code_verifier` — under `firewatch.pkce.transaction`, removed both when the callback consumes
it and on logout.

## Content Security Policy

`scripts/serve.mjs` sends this policy on every asset:

```text
default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:;
connect-src http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:8081; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';
form-action 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

Read it as written, not as stricter than it is:

- `script-src` allows only the app's own scripts, with **no** `'unsafe-inline'`.
- `style-src` **does** allow `'unsafe-inline'`.
- `img-src` allows the app's own images **and** `data:` URIs.
- `connect-src` allows exactly two origins. No wildcard, and nothing else is reachable.
- `default-src 'self'` covers every directive not named above.

The server answers only `GET` and `HEAD`, from an allowlist derived from the built entry
document — so a hashed filename is not a hole and a stray file in `assets/` is not reachable —
with no directory listing, no SPA fallback (routing is hash-based) and `Referrer-Policy:
no-referrer`. A real deployment must send an equivalent policy.

## Quality gates

```sh
npm run verify     # lint → typecheck → tests → source gate → build → smoke
```

| Command | What it establishes |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, flat config, TypeScript and React hooks rules |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, strict |
| `npm test` | Vitest: domain rules, transport, session, map projection, routing and the views |
| `npm run check` | The honesty statement is present, no fixture or frozen clock ships, the real endpoints are there, no client-side role guard, no persisted token, no secret, no external asset |
| `npm run build` | The production bundle |
| `npm run smoke` | Loopback: the built assets, MIME types, CSP, `HEAD`/`405`/`404`, traversal confinement |
| `npm run test:legacy` | The retired page's 60-assertion VM harness, kept green as the parity baseline |

## What is not verified

Automated checks do **not** establish visual correctness or accessibility, and they do not
exercise the real login path. The cross-origin round trip — signing in from
`http://localhost:4173` through Keycloak and logging out back to it — has **not** been executed
end to end in a browser. Treat that round trip as the real acceptance check, and see
[`backend/docs/keycloak-realm-setup.md`](../backend/docs/keycloak-realm-setup.md) for the realm
settings it depends on.

## History

This directory used to hold one self-contained page (`index.html`, `proposal.css`,
`proposal.js`) with no framework, no bundler and no build step. It is preserved byte for byte
in `legacy/`, and the branch that replaced it is `frontend/react-vite`. The retired mockup
that preceded *that* page is kept at
`odd/urgent/rediseno-pagina/referencia-mockup/`, and the history of its retirement is in
[`odd/tasks/architecture/gateway-frontend-separation.md`](../odd/tasks/architecture/gateway-frontend-separation.md).
